 
ðŸ“˜ Introduction:

This repository contains 150 efficient and beginner-friendly Java solutions to a wide range of coding problems, carefully selected to cover the essential topics in programming. The questions vary from basic to intermediate level, making this an ideal resource for learners at different stages of their coding journey. The aim of this repository is to help developers, students, and coding enthusiasts enhance their problem-solving abilities, strengthen core Java concepts, and prepare effectively for technical interviews. Each solution is written with clarity and includes inline comments to ensure the logic is easily understood, especially for those new to programming.

âœ¨ Features:

Topic-Wise Categorization: Problems are grouped into four major topics â€“ Numbers, Patterns, Strings, and Arrays â€“ covering the most commonly asked concepts in beginner-level coding rounds and Java practice sessions.
Beginner-Friendly Code: Every Java program is written in a clean, structured format with step-by-step logic and comments, making it easy to follow and modify.
Pure Java Implementation: All problems are solved using core Java, without any external libraries, focusing entirely on building logic with the language's built-in features.
Hands-On Practice: These problems simulate real-time coding tasks, providing a strong foundation for competitive programming, exams, and placement preparation.
Self-Paced Learning: Perfect for learners who want to build consistency and confidence through daily problem-solving using one of the most in-demand programming languages.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:

This repository is designed as a learning and revision tool for anyone who wants to practice Java through real problems. Whether you're a student learning Java for the first time, someone preparing for campus placements, or a programmer looking to brush up on the basics, this set of 150 problems will help you build the habit of thinking algorithmically. The problems are not only academically relevant but also reflect the kinds of questions commonly found in technical interviews and coding assessments.

ðŸ™Œ Get Involved:
