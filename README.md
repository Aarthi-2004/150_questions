Hi, I’m Aarthi.S, and this repository is a collection of 150 Java programming problems
 that I’ve personally worked on to strengthen my understanding of core 
Java concepts. The questions are organized into four major categories: Numbers, Patterns, Strings, and Arrays.
 Each section targets fundamental programming areas—ranging from 
number-based logic like palindrome checks and digit sums, to pattern 
printing using nested loops, to string manipulation tasks like reversing
 or counting characters, and array-based problems involving sorting, 
searching, and frequency analysis. These problems helped me improve my 
logical thinking, understand syntax deeply, and gain confidence in 
writing clean and efficient Java code.

This repository contains a curated collection of 150 Java programming questions focused on strengthening your core understanding of:
🔢 Numbers (basic math, digit operations, number theory)
🔁 Patterns (star patterns, number patterns)
🔣 Strings (manipulations, palindrome checks, frequency counts)
🔢 Arrays (sorting, searching, manipulation, subarray problems)

I created this repository not only for personal practice but also to help others who are preparing for coding interviews, academic assignments, or competitive programming challenges.
 Each file in the repository contains a clearly stated problem and a 
complete Java solution with proper structure and logic. It’s a great 
resource for beginners who are just starting their journey and for 
intermediate learners looking to sharpen their problem-solving skills. I
 hope this collection proves useful to others the same way it supported 
my learning.
